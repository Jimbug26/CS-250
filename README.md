How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Users will provide requests in plain english. To interpret that I will take my knowledge of programming and translate these requests into short, achievable tasks. User stories are a format to translate these tasks into a consistant format that describes the who, what, why of the tasks.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After taking this course I've adjusted the way I program. I now do shorter projects instead of trying to complete as much as possible in one sitting. I hope to incorporate the agile process of sprints into my future work. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a supervisor of a communication center I am going to say good communication between team members is a key to success. That communication can make you a good team member in other ways as well. This may come in the form of communicating feedback or collaborating with others.
